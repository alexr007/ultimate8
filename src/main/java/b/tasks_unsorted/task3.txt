The task is:

1. to recall the task from homework #1

2. reconsider it in OOP approach.

3. to represent the Event and Events in separate classes

4. to feel the difference, why we separated it into different classes

5. add extra functionality like:
    - you enter any year.
    - the program finds the closest event to this year
    - if you were able to choose the right answer from the first try
      - program prints "You are brilliant!"
    - if you were able to choose the right answer in the next 5 tries
      - program prints "You are so clever!"
    - if you weren't able to find the right answer in 5 tries
      - program prints "Keep learning!"
    - any your answer should be followed with a comment: "too big" or "too small"

6. keep track of all user's steps
   by saving all the data in the dedicated data structure like ArrayList
